# Problem statement
One thing that I noticed in Spotify's "Discover Weekly" playlist was that it was limited to 30 song and that it was only curated once a week and contained only 30 songs. I saw this as an opportunity to create a recommender system based on a user's most recently played songs and that could be ran whenever a user wanted to find new songs.

# Dataset
There are two datasets that I used for my recommender system.

The first [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-600k-tracks?select=tracks.csv) is a dataset gathered from Kaggle which contains ~600k tracks that I will be utilizing as the dataset where we will be pulling songs to recommend to the user.

The second dataset is data pulled from Spotify's API and looking at a user's most recently played songs and creating a dataframe containing the tracks and their song features.
